The official Green Up Day mobile app is a collaborative project built by a large group of volunteers.

The project started as a high school programming effort
led by John Need under the guidance of Lee-Ann Smith at the Essex STEM Academy.

Later, John Need brought the effort to Code for BTV, where John Need stayed on to
lead the project's first version to completion. Since then the project has received
yearly updates and fixes, and has been worked on by a large rotating cast of volunteer
civic technologists.

This is a probably incomplete list of the many people that have pushed this project forward.
Please feel free to add people if they are missing, and please give all of these people
a pat on the back if you see them.
